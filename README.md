## Hi there

Being an aerospace and electronics enthusiast, I spend most of my time developing software and electronic boards to support my projects.
I am currently developing an amateur rocket, controlled by an electronic board using a TVC (Thrust Vectoring Control).
On my profile you can find all the documents I have developed for my projects!
